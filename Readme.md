<font size = 16>Treebark Text Editor</font>
Treebark is a simple text editor written in c. It uses the gtk3 widget set.

**Installation**
There are two options for installation. You can download only the treebark installer(from releases), run it, and select "Install with Git". For this method, you will need to have git on your system.

Alternatively, you could clone the entire repository, and run ./build/installer from the resulting directory.
